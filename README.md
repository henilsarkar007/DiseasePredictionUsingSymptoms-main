# BE_DiseasePredictionUsingSymptoms

Disease prediction using Symptoms and provide preventive remedies.

**> Problem Statement:**<br>
	1.Classical diagnosis method is a process where the patient has to visit a doctor, undergo
	various medical test and then come to a conclusion.
	2.This process is very time consuming.

**> Our Solution:**<br>
	1.To save the time required and also money for initial process of diagnosis symptoms, this project
	proposes an automated disease prediction sysem that relies on user input.<br>
	2.The system takes input from user and provides a list of probable diseases.

**> More about project:**<br>
	1.Disease can be predicted using Multiple Algorithms like Random Forest ,Naive Bayesian algorithm which works on probabilistic approach
	more specifically Multinomial NB since multiple symptoms are taken.  <br>
	2.According to literature survey, Random Forest algorithm results in maximum accuracy for larger dataset.<br>
	3.The dataset contains disease as labels and for each disease symptoms are given.

 > [!IMPORTANT]
>System Requirement Python 3.x. Python 3.6 or a newer version is recommended<br>
```
pip install tk
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install scikit-learn
```

> [!NOTE]
> Dataset referred form [Disease-Symptom Knowledge Database](https://people.dbmi.columbia.edu/~friedma/Projects/DiseaseSymptomKB/index.html).
